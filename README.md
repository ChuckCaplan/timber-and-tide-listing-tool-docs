# Timber + Tide Listing Publisher

## Overview
Timber + Tide Listing Creator is a private, internal seller tool used exclusively by the owner of the Etsy shop **Timber + Tide**.  
It is not a public-facing application and is not distributed, sold, or made available to third parties.

The sole purpose of this application is to automate and streamline the creation and management of my own digital-download listings within my Etsy store.

## Purpose
This application programmatically creates, updates, and manages Etsy listings for digital artwork products that I sell as downloadable content.  
It is designed to reduce repetitive manual work, minimize listing errors, and ensure consistent metadata across large batches of digital products.

The tool is used only by me as the shop owner and does not provide functionality to buyers or other sellers.
